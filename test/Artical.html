            Software Engineering<br />
            Software engineering is the branch of computer science
            that deals with the design, development, testing, and
            maintenance of software applications.
        </p>
        Software engineers apply engineering principles and 
        knowledge of programming languages to 
        build software solutions for end users
        <p>
            A career as a software engineer can be both fun and challenging with 
            opportunities to work in almost any industry, including large and small
            businesses, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, healthcare facilities, and more. 
            And as technology continues to evolve, the need for software developers continues to grow. 
            Many companies are also shifting towards hiring software engineers who work from home, allowing 
            for increased flexibility and more opportunities to enter the field.
